# UnityiOSNativeCameraTest
example codes of Unity iOS camera implementation without using Webcamtexture
<br>

<b>Update 29/12/22:</b><br>
ãƒ»Added an AVCaptureMultiCam sample for iOS<br>
In the iOS player setting, you need to set up the minimum os version to 13.0 and default orientation setting to portrait.<br>
The MultiCam scene is the main scene to build.<br>
<br>
We only tested this sample on iPhone 12 pro with iOS 16.<br>
If you'd like to use this sample in your production, you need to take care of the memory and performance as well.<br>
We would also like you to recommend to check the following swift version of MultiCamCapture sample. There are a lots of good features to improve this sample code.<br>
